The peak of the Gaussian should be in the center of the array. Make sure to normalize the kernel such that the sum of all the elements in the array is 1. Use this function and the OpenCV’s `filter2D` routine to convolve the image and noisy image arrays with a 5x5 Gaussian kernel of sigma=1 and a 11x11 Gaussian kernel of sigma=2.

Perform an 11x11 convolution with sigma = 3 from question 1 using this scheme. You can still use `filter2D` to convolve the images with each of the 1D kernels. Verify that you get the same results with what you did with 2D kernels by computing the difference image between the results from the two methods. This difference image should be close to black.

    "- **Problem 4. Difference of Gaussians {20 pts}:** Difference of Gaussians (DoG) is a feature enhancement algorithm. You can obtain a DoG by subtracting a Gaussian filter of sigma=K\\*s from a Gaussian filter of sigma=s. In this question, we will use K=1.6 and sigma=2. Plot the DoG kernel using the `Matplotlib` function `plot`. Use the `Matplotlib` function `plot_surface` to generate a 3D plot of DoG. Include your code and results in your Colab Notebook file. Apply the filter to the noisy image generated in the previous question. "

    "- **Problem 5. Histogram equalization {20 pts}:** Refer to Szeliski's book on section 3.4.1, and within that section to eqn 3.9 for more information on histogram equalization. Getting the histogram of a grayscale image is incredibly easy with python. A histogram is a vector of numbers. Once you have the histogram, you can get the cumulative distribution function (CDF) from it. Then all you have left is to find the mapping from each value [0,255] to its adjusted value (just using the CDF basically). **DO NOT** use **cv2.equalizeHist()** directly to solve the exercise! We will expect to see in your code that you get the PDF and CDF, and that you manipulate the pixels directly (avoid a for loop, though). The ground-truth image is credit to https://github.com/yinhaoz/denoising-fluorescence. It is a real Fluorescence Microscopy Image with three R/G/B channels. You need to transform it into HSV space before doing histogram equalization. There will be one output image from this part which is the histogram equalized image. It will be compared against the ground truth."
